# GonnaGoFast
Simple Endless Runner

To play the game, simply extract the file "GonnaGoFastActualGame" to a folder of your choice and run the .exe file.

The file "GonnaGoFastUnityGameFiles" is a Unity project that can be added to Unity Hub.

The music "Jim Hall - The Contra Chop" is not by me, but by Jim Hall.
